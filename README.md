To run the program, type "python -m pip install streamlit" and then "python -m streamlit run test.py"
Purpose: To help solve any sort of discrimination in workplace hiring we created a website called 'FairHire' to ensure no discrimnation when hiring individuals for jobs. This website eliminates the applicants personal identificators such as name, gender, race, or address. Employers can read the applicants resume and select one or more to move onto the next round.
